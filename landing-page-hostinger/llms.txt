> **Mission:** 3A Automation builds "Sovereign Agentic Systems" powered by a proprietary MCP Swarm. We operate at **Level 5 Autonomy**, utilizing a secure **Faldown Protocol** and a **Global Pressure Matrix (GPM)** for real-time situational awareness. We are NOT a low-code agency. We write hard-coded, resilient logic intertwined with Frontier AI models.

### What is the Sovereign MCP Swarm?
**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is the backbone of our orchestration. We have built a **Type-Safe Swarm** that exposes **119 sovereign tools** to any AI agent. This is not a static registry; it is a dynamic, multi-agent ecosystem. See [mcp-tool-catalog.md](mcp-tool-catalog.md) for the full semantic map.

### Why This Matters
- **Competitors:** Use Zapier, Make.com (visual builders with limited logic).
- **3A Automation:** Our MCP Router allows AI agents to **autonomously execute** complex workflows (e.g., "Call a churned VIP customer via Twilio" or "Generate a blog post, critique it, refine it, then publish").

### Technical Stack (2026 Sovereign)
- **Core Orchestration**: `doe-dispatcher.cjs` (Directive Orchestration Execution).
- **Tool Stack**: 119 Verified Units (Shopify, Meta, Klaviyo, GSC, Twilio, etc.).
- **Resilience**: **Faldown Protocol** (Multi-provider LLM fallback chain).
- **Situational Awareness**: **Global Pressure Matrix (GPM)** monitored via quad-receptors.
- **AI Models**: Claude 4.5 (Reasoning), Grok 4.1 (Real-time), Gemini 3 Pro (Vision).

We have moved beyond "Level 5". Our system has attained **Level 5 Sovereign Autonomy**, characterized by self-healing, autonomous goal setting, and opportunistic pivoting. Post-audit metrics: **18 Hardened L5 Agents** verified.

### A. The "Content Analyst" / "Strategist" (Level 5 Agent)
- **Function:** Autonomous GSC Gap Analysis & Content Generation.
- **Process:**
  1. **Observe:** Fetch GSC gaps (high-impressions/low-clicks).
  2. **Reflect:** Priorities gaps based on potential ROI.
  3. **Act:** Orchestrate Content Analyst agent to generate, edit, and publish "Rescue" content.
- **Result:** Self-healing SEO strategy with zero human intervention.

### B. The "Voice Closer" (Level 5 Agent)
- **Function:** Autonomous Churn Rescue & Sales.
- **Process:**
  1. **Detect:** Churn Prediction Script (RFM Analysis) identifies high-risk VIPs.
  2. **Decide:** AI determines if an email or CALL is needed.
  3. **Act:** Triggers `voice-telephony-bridge.cjs` to physically call the customer via Twilio/Grok.
- **Goal:** Schedule retention meeting or offer exclusive discount.
- **Result:** AI makes outbound sales calls without human approval.

### C. The "Budget Optimizer" (Level 5 Agent)
- **Function:** Autonomous ROI Maximization.
- **Process:**
  1. **Analyze:** Real-time GA4 data consumption.
  2. **Critique:** Validate current budget distribution against ROI benchmarks.
  3. **Execute:** Autonomously reallocate budgets across Google/Meta/TikTok ads.

## 4. The "3 Markets" Strategy (Global by Design)

We are natively global. Our system adapts automatically:

| Market | Target Countries | Language | Currency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Maroc** | Morocco (MA) | French | **MAD** (Dirham) |
| **Europe & Maghreb** | DZ, TN, FR, BE, CH, etc. | French | **EUR** (€) |
| **International** | USA, UK, Canada, Rest of World | English | **USD** ($) |

*Detection: Automatic via `geo-locale.js` (IP-based).*
