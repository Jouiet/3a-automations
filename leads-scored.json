    "feedback": "The scoring logic is overly linear and fails to differentiate between passive engagement and high-intent signals. Weighting 'Demo Requests' (bottom-of-funnel) the same as generic 'Form Submissions' (often top-of-funnel) dilutes lead quality. Furthermore, 'Email Opens' are weighted too heavily given their unreliability due to privacy protections (MPP). There is a critical lack of time-decay logic; lead_002 is over 30 days old but carries no penalty. Finally, the provided sample leads show a 'score' of 0 despite an 'activity_score' being present, suggesting a failure in the calculation engine or a lack of granular event data mapping.",
