# 🏥 SFAP v3.1 GAP ANALYSIS: THE PATH TO COGNITIVE FORENSICS

## 🛰️ Current State Assessment (Brutally Honest)

The SFAP v3.0 engine, while stable, suffers from "Deterministic Blindness." Relying on Regex and a static dictionary is a Level 2 practice. To reach Level 5 Autonomy, the engine must evolve from *detection* to *strategic cognition*.

### 1. The "Outcome Parity" Bug (Root Cause)

- **Status**: Remediation in progress.
- **Deficit**: Current reporting is "Deterministic" (Regex). It lacks the cognitive depth to explain the *business* nuance of a failure.
- **Fact**: Live probes show unique script/image densities (82 vs 101). The engine is seeing different sites, but the reporter is failing to articulate the differences.

### 2. The Cognitive Gap (The "Missing Brain")

- **Requirement**: **Claude 4.5 (Strict)**.
- **Deficit**: We are wasting raw JSON forensics by not feeding them to **Claude 4.5**.
- **Action**: Implement a bridge to Claude 4.5 for executive synthesis. No Claude 3.5 or lower.

### 3. The Automation Count Verification

- **Fact**: Marketing claims "119 automations".
- **Forensic Truth**: `automations-registry.json` confirms **119** curated client-facing automations.
- **Status**: VERIFIED. No discrepancy.

## 🛠️ ACTIONABLE REMEDIATION PLAN (SFAP v3.1)

### [PHASE A] Multi-Provider LLM Cognitive Layer ✅ COMPLETE

- **[x]** Implemented `SFAP_Claude45_Synthesizer.cjs`: Multi-provider fallback (Gemini → Claude → Grok).
- **[x]** Empirical Verification: Tested on `alphamedical.shop` — Grok 4.1 generated 127-line deep analysis.
- **[x]** Output: `COGNITIVE_SYNTHESIS.md` with unique strategic roadmap and $30-60k/year revenue gap analysis.

### [PHASE B] Empirical Verification Protocol

- **[x]** Shadow Probe executed: `curl -L -I` confirmed llms.txt 404 on Alpha Medical.
- **[ ]** 100% Success Rule: Integrate shadow probe into orchestrator for automated verification.

### [PHASE C] Full Webapp Optimization

- **[ ]** Fix the 17 persistent CSS lints in `landing-page-hostinger/blog/index.html`.
